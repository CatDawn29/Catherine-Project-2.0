# Catherine-Project-2.0

The who and what of my problem:
- My business problem is determining who is more likely to suffer a stroke by seeing what sypmtoms these people have in common. My stakeholders are the drug companies that are trying to develop medicine to help prevent strokes.

-The source of my data is from the kaggle website and the actual data is from numerous hospitals and studies.

What my data is about:
- My data is showing the symptoms of people who are more likely to have a stroke. It shows how having a higher BMI, hypertension, heart disease is more likely to lead to a stroke. 

Here are two graphs from my data that I created:

These two grapsh show different information but overall it explains that if you have higher bmi, hypertension and have heart disease, then you are at a higher chance for having a stroke. It also shows that it really doesn't matter if you are a male or a female but if you aren't being healthy than you are at a risk for having a stroke.

- Here are the metrics for my best model: 

Why this is the best model
- Best Production Model would be to use would be the KNN Classifier due to the fact that their accuracy, which would lead to higher results in producing a drug that can help prevent a stroke. The number for this is 0.9574468085106383.

- This model shows if we can target these specific sypmtoms than we can help develop a drug that can help prevent a stroke.

My findings:
1. My first recommendation would be to develop a drug that can target both hypertension and heart disease that would decrease both, due to my analtyical insight in my first graph. 
2. My second recommendation would be to create a drug that would just target hypertension and to decrease it. Decreasing hypertension would than decrease heart disease as well, and that shows in both of my graphs. 
3. My third overall recommendation is for more of a encouragment for having a healthy lifestyle.
